  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i139.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="T">

</center>
<p class="drop-cap">TO the younger readers of the
twentieth century the great war
of 1861-65, fought to maintain the
authority of the national government
and to preserve the union of the States,
may sometimes seem remote and impersonal.
The passage of time has healed the
bitterness and animosity which an older generation
can remember, and if proof were
needed of the real union of our country it was
shown when South and North marched side
by side under the old flag in the war with
Spain. It is well that the passions of war
should be laid aside, but the examples of
heroism on both sides and the lessons of
patriotism are something always to be kept
in mind. Grant and Lee, Sherman, Sheridan,
“Stonewall” Jackson—figures like these are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
not to be forgotten—and personal views of
some of these leaders will be found in this
book.</p>

<p>Of the great campaigns of those terrible
four years, when vast armies marched and
countermarched and wrestled in battles of
giants, there are many accounts, and yet the
necessarily limited space allotted in short
histories may well be supplemented by narratives
alive with human interest. That is the
purpose of this book. Mr. Henderson’s recollections,
which serve as a prologue, will take
the boy of to-day back to these eventful
years and make him realize what it was to
live in the days when North and South were
summoning their sons to arms. Mr. Shackleton’s
dramatic story is the first of some imaginative
tales of the war which aim to preserve
the atmosphere of those thrilling days
in the guise of fiction. The stories which
follow—“The Blockade Runner” and “Two
Days with Mosby,” are believed to be essentially
relations of actual experiences; and the
balance of the book, including the tales of
Lincoln, Worden and the Monitor, Sheridan’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
Ride, and Lee’s surrender, is vivid, first-hand
history. One feature of this book is that
the latter stories are told by those who took
an actual part. This is a book of adventure
and of heroic deeds, which are not only of absorbing
interest, but they also bring a closer
realization of the one country which was
welded together in the furnace of the Civil
War.</p>

<p>More extended versions of the narratives
by L. E. Chittenden and General G. A.
Forsyth are presented in the former’s <i>Recollections
of Lincoln</i> and the latter’s <i>Thrilling
Days of Army Life</i>.</p>

<small>A BOY’S IMPRESSIONS OF THE CIVIL WAR</small></h2>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i015.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="E">


<p class="drop-cap">EVERY time I see the citizen
soldiers of the National Guard
march down the avenue I have a
choking sensation in my throat,
and sometimes tears come to my eyes. A
young man who stood beside me one day
when I could not help making an exhibition
of myself, said, “What’s the matter with
you?” And my answer was, “They make
me think of the men I saw going to the front
in war-times.” Then the young man laughed,
and said, “What can you remember of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
the war?” He was about twenty-three or
twenty-four years of age, and the Civil War
was to him something to be read of in a dusty
book. I was five years old when the war
began. I could read and write, and was
going to school. Many of the things which
I saw then made impressions on my mind
never to be effaced this side of the grave.</p>

<p>I was living in the city of Pittsburg, at the
junction of the Alleghany and Monongahela
rivers, whose waters, joined in the Ohio,
flowed past many a field that will live in
history. Pittsburg was not in the midst of
the war, but it was close enough to some
scenes of action, especially Gettysburg, and
important enough as a point of departure
and source of supplies to keep it filled with
soldiers, and warmly in touch with all that
was going on. What I wish to tell you is
something about the way it all appeared to a
boy.</p>

<p>My first recollection is of my father reading
from a newspaper the announcement
that Major Anderson and his garrison at
Fort Sumter had been fired upon. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
was in April, 1861, and I was in my sixth
year; but I remember that I was greatly
excited, and wondered what it all meant.
It must have been later than that when my
father gave me an explanation, which I remember
to this day. He said: “My little
boy, there is war between the people of the
North and those of the South. The people
in the South want to have slaves, and the
people in the North say they must not have
them. So the people of the South say they
will not belong to the United States any
more, and the people of the North say they
must. And so they are fighting, and the
fighting will go on till one or the other is
beaten.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>All at once Pittsburg became alive with
military preparations. Drums were beating
in the streets all day and far into the night.
Every hour a detachment of soldiers would
march along Smithfield Street, and as I lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
just above the corner of it on Second Street,
now called Second Avenue, I would run to
see every squad go by, till it became tiresome,
and nothing short of a regiment could interrupt
my play. Those must have been the
seventy-five thousand volunteers called for by
Abraham Lincoln to serve three months and
crush the rebellion. Some of those men came
back at the end of their three months, but of
that I remember little or nothing. The only
thing that made a strong impression on me
in the early days of the war, after the attack
on Sumter, was the killing of Ellsworth. I
suppose every boy knows now how the gallant
young Colonel of the New York Fire Zouaves
took down the Confederate flag that was
flying over an inn in Alexandria, and was
shot dead by the proprietor of the house,
who was immediately killed by Private
Brownell.</p>

<p>That incident fired the hearts of all the
boys in Pittsburg. We could not understand
much of what we heard about the movements
of troops, and I have forgotten everything
which may have reached my ears at the time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
But we could understand the murder of
Ellsworth, and to this day I remember how
we little fellows burned with indignation,
and how we all wished we had been Brownell
to shoot down the innkeeper. Somehow
the untimely fate of the brave young Zouave
commander appealed to us very forcibly, and
I think some of us cried about it. It appealed
to our mothers too, and suddenly the little
boys in Pittsburg began to blossom out
in Zouave suits. My mother had one made
for me—a light-blue jacket with brass
buttons, a red cap, and red trousers. She
bought me a little flag, and had my picture
taken in my uniform, and she has that
picture yet. Next she got me a little tin
sword; and then two older boys procured
blue army overcoats and caps, and borrowed
two muskets from the property-man at the
theatre, and I used to drill those boys, and
march them proudly all over Pittsburg, to
the intense delight of the grown-up people,
who cheered us wherever we went.</p>

<p>The next thing which remains indelibly
fixed in my memory is the surprise and terror<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
which flashed across the whole North when
we heard the news from Bull Run. Of
course I do not remember the date of the battle,
and I am obliged to refer to my history
to find that it took place in July, 1861. But
we boys in Pittsburg had been indulging in
much loud talk, as boys will, of the way in
which our soldiers were going to blow out the
rebellion, as one would blow out a candle;
and here came the news that these miserable
rebels, whom we despised, had thrashed our
glorious army terribly, and were thinking
about walking into Washington. My impressions
at the time were that a lot of
Southern slave-drivers, armed with snake
whips and wearing slouch-hats, would soon
arrive in Pittsburg and make us all stand
around and obey orders. My father about
this time used to pace the floor in deep
thought after reading the newspaper, and
used to set off for business with a bowed head.
Later in life I learned that in those days he
drew his last twenty-five dollars out of the
bank, and did not know where more was to
come from. But I thought he expected to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
be killed or made a slave. The boys used to
discuss what steps they would take if the
rebels came, and it was pretty generally
agreed that we would all have to run across
the Monongahela River bridge, climb Coal
Hill, and hide in the mines.</p>

<p>From the time of Bull Run to the assassination
of Abraham Lincoln my boyhood
memories, as they come back to me now,
present no orderly sequence of events. In a
dim way I remember the distress and consternation
caused by the dread event at
Ball’s Bluff, and in an equally uncertain
way I remember how we cheered and danced
when the news of a victory arrived. Just
across the street from my father’s house stood
the Homœopathic Hospital, and next to it
was a vacant lot in which pig-iron was stored.
There we boys were wont to resort. We sat
on the piles of pig metal and gravely discussed
the progress of the war, and I well
remember that one of my earliest combats
arose from my proclaiming my belief that
General Burnside was a greater man than
George B. McClellan. That was rank treason;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
but I think Burnside’s whiskers made a
conquest of me. I will add that the dispute
ended in a triumphant victory for the defender
of McClellan’s fame. Thereupon I
went home to my mother and “told on” the
defender. I got little consolation, for my
mother said: “Don’t come to me. If a
boy hits you, you must hit back; but don’t
come in crying to me.” We were a warlike
race in those days.</p>

<p>Gettysburg is a word that conjures up
memories for me. We thought we had seen
soldiers in Pittsburg before that, but we had
simply seen samples. When the Confederates
invaded Pennsylvania, we found ourselves
in a most unpleasant place; but we had
plenty of excitement. From early dawn till
late at night drums were beating in the streets
and the walls of the houses echoed the tread
of many feet. For three weeks I never set
my foot inside the Second Ward School in
Ross Street, where I was supposed to be, but
every morning I stole quietly across the
bridge and ascended Coal Hill. Do you
know what was going on up there? Soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
were working like beavers, throwing up earthworks.
Similar operations were in progress
on every hill around the city, and many
an hour I spent carrying water for the boys
in the hot sun.</p>

<p>When I descended the hill I always went
to the yard at the Birmingham end of the
bridge, and watched the workmen who were
building Monitors. I do not remember how
many Monitors were built there, but I remember
very distinctly seeing the launch of
the <i>Manayunk</i>. Later she steamed away
down the Ohio, and I knew no more of her.
The original <i>Monitor</i>, the wonderful little
craft that so ably defended the <i>Minnesota</i> in
Hampton Roads, was my special object of
worship in those days. Little did I dream
then that I should live to know the sea as
well as I do, or to drill on the deck of the
<i>Minnesota</i>. The <i>Monitor’s</i> success in her
great duel with the <i>Merrimac</i> filled all of us
boys with excitement. We promptly built
<i>Monitors</i> with round boxes placed on shingles
sharpened at both ends. Then we made
<i>Merrimacs</i> of an equally rude type. Next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
we went down to the river, and in the still
water between the big stern-wheelers that
lay with their noses against the levee, we
had some of the most tremendous naval
engagements that ever escaped the eye of
history. And the <i>Merrimac</i> was always defeated,
whereupon she retreated up the river
and promptly blew herself up. Those were
good times!</p>

<p>But when the man came with the Great
Diorama of the War we learned something
new. A diorama is, to be Hibernian, just
like a panorama, only it is different. In a
panorama you see pictures; in a diorama you
see moving figures cut out in profile. After
each scene the curtain must be lowered and
the stage reset. I remember that this man
(I wish I knew his name) began his entertainment
with an ordinary series of panoramic
views, after which the curtain fell, and we
prepared ourselves for the new revelation.
When the curtain rose again, we saw a
miniature stage set with scenic waters. In
the background were two large ships, cut
out in profile, and in the distance were two or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
three more. The next moment we were
startled by seeing a flash shoot out from the
side of one, followed by a dull boom. Then
the other big ship fired, and next the forts,
which were at the sides, opened up. We
began to tingle with excitement, and could
hardly remain in our seats.</p>

<p>Suddenly a long, low craft, looking something
like an inverted cake-pan, came gliding
out at the front of the stage. Then we knew
we were looking at the feared and hated
<i>Merrimac</i>. She opened fire on the ships.
Then she circled round, and, putting on
steam, rushed against one of them with her
ram. The poor wooden vessel careened far
over on one side. Then the <i>Merrimac</i>
drew back, and hurled two shots into her at
short range. The big ship began to sink.
She went clear away down out of sight—royals,
trucks, and all. Next the <i>Merrimac</i>
went for the other ship; but just then we
saw another queer craft sail on. “It was
the immortal cheese-box on a plank”—the
<i>Monitor</i>. The <i>Merrimac</i> paused. The two
iron-clads seemed to stop and look at each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
other. Then they rushed together. And
how they spit fire and banged and butted!
We boys were crazy with excitement. And
when suddenly the <i>Merrimac</i> blew up with a
loud report, and the <i>Monitor</i> displayed half
a dozen American flags, we cheered till we
were hoarse. It was not strictly according
to history, but it was glorious. And we boys
went right home, and began building a Grand
Diorama of the War in the cellar of the St.
Charles Hotel the next day. That diorama
would have been a tremendous success but
for one thing. Jim Rial’s brother dropped a
match into the powder-bottle, which blew
up the diorama and nearly blinded the boy.
However, we built another diorama; and the
boy got well.</p>

<p>But to return to Gettysburg. When
troops were being hurried forward to that
point from every direction, thousands of
soldiers passed through Pittsburg. Many
of them were sent out by the Pittsburg and
Connellsville Railroad to Uniontown, and
thence to the front. Every afternoon I used
to go to the Connellsville station, at the foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
of Ross Street, and ride out on the four-o’clock
train as far as the historic Braddock’s
Field, where, you remember, the British
commander Braddock refused to take Washington’s
advice in the matter of Indian-fighting,
and paid the penalty. This station
was just ten miles out, and I could get back
in time for supper. Attached to every train
out in those days were several flat-cars with
planks laid across from side to side for seats,
and these cars were loaded with soldiers. I
always rode in one of those cars, and listened
in breathless awe to the conversation of those
real live soldiers who were going out to fight.
As I remember them now, they were hearty,
good-natured fellows, very kind to the little
boy who took so much interest in them.
And when I returned to Pittsburg I used to
dream about them at night, and wake up
very early in the morning to listen for the
sound of the guns of the approaching invaders.
I was no worse than older people.
Many a good woman in Pittsburg went on
the roof very often to listen for those same
guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Another thing which I remember very
distinctly is the work we used to do in the
public schools in those days. Every afternoon
we devoted a part of our time to picking
lint. We were told by our teachers that it
was to be sent to the front, where it would be
used in dressing the wounds of the soldiers.
None of us dreamed of the real horrors of
war, but I think our hearts were in that work
just the same. And we used to get our
mothers to make housewives, which we filled
with combs, brushes, and soap; and these,
too, were sent to the front. We saw soldiers
going to war every day with no other baggage
than their knapsacks, and we well understood,
children as we were, that the housewife
would be welcome in every tent.</p>

<p>And finally came the news of Appomattox.
Guns were fired, and people cheered, and we
boys simply danced war-dances all over the
city. Soon the troops began to come home,
and then we had our eyes opened a bit.
The boys of to-day see the old fellows of the
Grand Army of the Republic turn out in
their sober blue uniforms, carrying the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
battle-flags carefully wrapped up, and the
boys think them a monotonous lot, and take
little interest in them. But I saw them
come back with their bare feet sticking out
of their ragged shoes, with the legs of their
trousers and the arms of their coats hanging
in tatters, with the army blue faded by the
sun and washed by the rain to a sickly
greenish-gray, with their faces baked and
frozen and blown till they looked like sheets
of sole-leather, saving the happy smiles they
bore. And I saw those old battle-flags come
back with their rent and shivered stripes
streaming in the wind, while strong men stood
looking on with tears in their eyes. And I
saw one of my uncles, who had been a prisoner
in Andersonville, come to Pittsburg with a
gangrened foot, which my mother dressed
every day. I shall never forget his condition,
nor that of the heroes who marched
through Pittsburg day after day when the
war was over. I am sorry there had to be a
war; but I am unspeakably grateful that I
was old enough to get those impressions,
which will live as long as I do. They spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
to life again whenever I see troops on the
march, and they give the old flag a meaning
for me which I think it cannot have for those
without my memories.</p>

<small>THE CAPTAIN OF COMPANY Q</small></h2>

<p class="center"><i>The Tale of an Unenlisted Soldier</i></p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i031.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Z">

<p class="drop-cap">ZEBEDEE was the Captain of
Company Q. Sheer merit had
won him the title. He was the
first and the last of his kind. He
stood unique. For it was the only Company
Q that had ever been captained—Company
Q being the stragglers and camp-followers,
miscellaneous and heterogeneous,
who drift in an army’s wake.</p>

<p>Unique though Zebedee’s position was,
it was far from satisfying the ambition
that he had once cherished. For he had
longed to be a soldier. He had dreamed
of doing great deeds; of rising from the
ranks, of steadily mounting upward, of
winning lofty title and mighty fame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>But the surgeon curtly refused him. It
was the heart, he said. And when Zebedee,
amazed, bewildered, for he had never suspected
himself to be a sick man, stammered a protest,
the surgeon said a few cutting words
about worthless men trying to get in for pay
and pension—which words were to Zebedee
as blows. And he yielded with such bleak finality
as never again to ask for enlistment.</p>

<p>But although he himself could scarcely
explain how it came to pass, he found himself
a camp-follower, a drudge, a volunteer
servant to the command of a general to whose
fame he gave humble and admiring awe. At
first the soldiers had tolerated him; gradually
there had come a recognition of his willingness,
his good-nature, his real cleverness.
It somehow came to be believed that it was
by some vagrant choice of his own that he
was a member of Company Q, and none ever
dreamed that he longed with pathetic intensity
for his lost chance of being a soldier.
On the march he wore a look of exaltation
whenever, which was not seldom, two or
three of the men would carelessly give him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
their muskets to carry. In the camp he was
happy if he could do some service—he would
chop wood, build fires, and cook. And in
time of battle he was perforce resigned when
the soldiers marched by him into the smoke
and the roar, leaving him behind to hold
some officer’s horse or look after some tent.</p>

<p>But the innate spirit that, if given the
opportunity, would have carried him far upward,
made him master of the motley members
of Q, and it gradually came to be that
his words had the force of law with them.</p>

<p>He never assumed a complete uniform.
His very reverence for it and for all that it
represented kept him from such a height of
undeserved glory. But he tried to satisfy
his craving soul with the tattered jacket of an
artilleryman, a shabby cavalry cap, and the
breeches of infantry; and the sartorial dissimilitude,
through the working of some
obscure logic, obviated presumption yet kept
alive some pride.</p>

<p>How it happened that Zebedee was so
often in dangerous places which the other
members of Company Q carefully avoided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
was a puzzle to the soldiers, and it came to
be ascribed to a sort of blundering heedlessness—not
bravery, of course, for he was only
a camp-follower.</p>

<p>And one day, when the command failed
in its attack upon a fort, Zebedee found himself
with the handful who fled for safety close
up against the hostile works. There they
were protected from shots from above; and
the enemy dared not, on account of a covering
fire, come out into the open to attack
them; and there they hoped to stay till darkness
should permit retreat.</p>

<p>But the day was blisteringly hot, and thirst
began to madden them. Then Zebedee
slung about him a score of canteens, and
dashed out across the plain, and lead rained
pitilessly about him as he jingled on, but
he was not hit. His canteens were swiftly
filled by friendly hands, and he turned to go
back across that deadly space.</p>

<p class="caption">THEN ZEBEDEE DASHED OUT ACROSS THE PLAIN</p>

<p>He knew that fire would flash along the
hostile works; that lead again would rain;
but he did not waver. He saw the dark line
of his comrades, he knew their misery, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
could at least give one life for his
country—and the men watched him with awe as,
with a curious gravity, he, about to die, saluted
them in farewell and ran unhesitatingly
out. A sort of glory was upon his countenance.
There was a hush. Friend and
enemy alike were awed and still. No sound
was heard but the rapid patter of his feet.
There came no flash and smoke, no splintering
sound of musketry. But there arose a
mighty shout—friends and enemies alike
were cheering him!—and he sank, hysterically
sobbing, among his comrades.</p>

<p>This, of course, brought about important
recognition. The General heard of it; heard,
too, that the Captain of Company Q did not,
from some crotchet, some whimsy, wish to
be a regular soldier.</p>

<p>“Zebedee,” he said, “you are a brave
man.”</p>

<p>Zebedee’s heart beat high with hope, and
the look of exaltation shone in his eyes.
Not knowing whether or not to use words,
or what words to use, he could only stand
stiffly at salute—he knew how to salute, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
no drill-master had ever paid attention
to him; he had eagerly watched and
practised, and was perfect at this as at many
other things. He stood rigidly at salute—but
his eyes were like the eyes of a faithful
dog that hungrily watches his master for a
bone.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you are not an enlisted man,
Zebedee.”</p>

<p>Ah! how high his heart beat now! To be
a corporal—perhaps even a sergeant—</p>

<p>The General went on, speaking slowly so
that the full sense of his condescension should
sink in: “And so, you shall be my own personal
servant.”</p>

<p>Zebedee stood rigid as if he were a piece
of mechanism, and all expression was swept
from his face as marks are swept from a
slate.</p>

<p>And having thus conferred honor, the
General went out; he, the great warrior so
able to discern the hidden movements of an
opposing army, to read the secret plans of
an enemy, but quite unable to discern the
poignant suffering of a brave man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Zebedee was a sturdy man, not given to
running away or to changeableness. In his
heart—the heart of which the surgeon had
spoken so contemptuously—he had enlisted
for the war; he would not be permitted, so it
seemed, to fight the good fight, but he must
patiently finish the course and keep the
faith.</p>

<p>What mattered it now that by observation
he had learned many things besides how to
salute! With bitter resignation he would
watch the coming and going of officers, the
forms and ceremonies of war. At dress
parade he knew just when the drums were to
march slowly down from the right flank; just
when there was to be the thrice-repeated,
long, brisk roll; just when the drums were
to turn back, with quicker step; just how the
commanding officer out there in front would
keep his hand upon the hilt of his sword; just
when the adjutant would take his place at the
front of the line; just when was to come the
command, “First sergeants to the front and
centre!” The roll of drums, and the crash
of music, and the tramp of many feet—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the Captain of Company Q would turn away,
his eyes filled with tears, as vague visions
came of the heights to which he had aspired
when he hurried to enlist—before he knew
he had a heart. But he knew it now; he
knew it, and it hurt.</p>

<p>In the uncommunicative companionship
of General and servant he learned much.
He learned to know and almost to love the
stern, strong man, who held his men in iron
discipline and led them into battle with a
fierceness that was almost joy.</p>

<p>There came, too, a sort of liking for Zebedee
on the part of the grim officer. He trusted
him, sometimes let him write orders, treated
him with a curt kindliness, and often permitted
him to remain within hearing when
discussions went on.</p>

<p>And Zebedee, still in touch with Company
Q, which stood more in awe of him than ever,
and in touch, since his day of glory, with the
men, came also to know and to understand
the officers. By observation, divination,
putting together this and that, he came to
know how much depended upon the personality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
of the General, and how bitter was
the rivalry among those next in command;
he knew that they would do their utmost
under the overmastering influence of their
leader’s spirit, but that jealousy and laxity
would work disaster should the potent headship
be lost.</p>

<p>And with this there came to Zebedee a new
sense of responsibility and pride. When so
much depended upon the General, surely the
importance was great of the servant who saw
to it that he should sleep in comfort and
properly eat!</p>

<p>He no longer wore the old clothes whose
acquisition had been such pride to him. The
General had given him some of his own cast-off
things, which fitted him measurably well
and relieved the shabbiness of effect which
would not have consorted with his present
dignity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There had been a day of fighting, a day of
doubt. The General, almost overwhelmingly
outnumbered, had fought with splendid skill.
But as night fell there went shiveringly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
through the ranks the rumor that he had
been desperately hurt.</p>

<p>The General lay unconscious in his tent.
Absolute quiet had been ordered. Zebedee
must watch him, nurse him, tend him, and
the sentinels must keep even the highest
officers away. The sentinels’ duty would be
well done, for iron discipline had taught
each man to hold the General’s tent a thing
sacred.</p>

<p>Absolute silence had been ordered. And,
as if heeding, the rattle of musketry died
away, the sullen cannon stopped from muttering,
even there ceased the sound of trampling
feet, of rolling wagons, of the swinging
tinkle of canteens. Only the chirring hum
of frogs and katydids and tree-toads, the
multitudinous murmur of a Virginia summer
night, was heard. Then from far in
the distance came solemnly the strain, “My
country, ’tis of thee,” and the soul of Zebedee
was thrilled and uplifted as never before in
his poor life.</p>

<p>Once in a while the chief surgeon hurried
back from the multitude of other cases that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the day had given. In piercing anxiety
Zebedee watched by the General’s side.
“Has there been any change?” “There has
been no change.”</p>

<p>Slowly the hours marched towards morning.
The chief surgeon again appeared and
led Zebedee outside the tent. “There will
be an advance and an engagement at daybreak.
The General will sleep for hours. I
may be unable to come in again for a while.
Be sure to let him sleep. I depend upon
you, Zebedee.”</p>

<p>Zebedee had held all surgeons to be his
enemies, but here was one that roused his
humble devotion. And the words crystallized
a feeling which had already come over
him with almost oppressive weight—the feeling
that upon him, Zebedee, there lay a heavy
responsibility. He thought of the renewed
battle, now so imminent, and as by a flash
of inspiration he saw the results of jealousy
and half-hearted co-operation; he saw the
soldiers, like frightened children, making an
ineffectual stand; the impotency of his position
came upon him like pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>He glanced from the tent. A nebulous
lustre marked the glow from the enemy’s
fires. Through the air came faintly the
mysterious light that tells of the coming
of morning. A dull slow wind crept laggard
by. Statued sentinels stood stiff and still.
Two dimly outlined aides conversed in cautious
sibilation. Silently he drew back and
returned to the General’s side.</p>

<p>The General still slept. To Zebedee’s
anxious ears a soft thudding told of soldiers
marching through the feeble light. The
sound increased. He knew that shadows
were passing by. There was the crunch of
heavy wheels and he knew that cannon,
sulkily tossing their lowered heads from side
to side, were being dragged unwillingly towards
fight. Faintly audible firing began in
the far distance, and the sulky cannon set up
a hoarse and excited cry.</p>

<p>The laggard dawn came with a plumping
rain. The candle in the bayonet end flamed
yellow. The sounds of distant battle grew
more loud.</p>

<p>The General opened his eyes. He sighed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
with a great weariness. He listened to the
sounds, and thought himself again a boy, on
a farm, hearing the homely noise of breakfast-dishes
and milk-cans and wagons. “I can’t
get up—I’m tired,” he said, and his voice was
as the querulous voice of a boy. His eyes
fell upon Zebedee, and the tense look of
dread anxiety almost roused him. He sat
up; then fell back, smiling quietly. “I
have always trusted you, Zebedee,” he said,
simply, in such a tone as Zebedee had never
before heard; “always—trusted—you.” And
with that, he was dead.</p>

<p>Dead, and the battle was on. To Zebedee
it meant the end of all things precious. His
mind in its agony lost all sense of proportion.
The General was dead!—that was the one
important fact in all the universe.</p>

<p>A shell flew over the tent. Already the
enemy were advancing! Another shell, and
another and another. They fascinated him.
In their sounds they marked the full range
of life and of passion. One shrieked, one
groaned, one muttered like a miser counting
gold, one whispered like a child, one was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
petulant, one expostulated, one whispered
softly like a maid confessing love. Zebedee
shivered. Suddenly the shell sounds turned
to taunts. He could have wept from very
impotence. He felt choking, smothered.
Passionate cannon began a louder uproar.</p>

<p>The General was dead. Yes; that was the
one important fact in all the universe. He,
only he, knew!—And suddenly there came
an awesome thought.</p>

<p>Even from the first frightened contemplation
of it he snatched a fearful joy. He
steadied himself. He drew himself up to his
full height. He drew a deep breath and
stretched out his arms as a man preparing
for some feat of strength. His face grew
strange, and a thousand tiny wrinkles aged
him as the thought bewilderingly grew. His
breath came in queer respirations.</p>

<p>The sinister droning of another shell—and
doubt fell from him like a garment.</p>

<p>The astonished aides saw the General come
forth into the rain, with hat drawn over his
face and collar turned up high. Something
of menacing austerity in his motions repressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
all words of sympathy or dissuasion.
In an instant he was upon a horse and had set
off at headlong gallop for the front.</p>

<p>Panic had already begun. Men were confusedly
huddling, firing distractedly and at
random. A curious quaking cry was beginning
to arise—the cry of frightened men
in hysteria; and ranks were beginning to
crumble, and soldiers were on the verge of
tumultuous retreat.</p>

<p>But now the General was there! Like
magic the news spread. His very presence
checked the panic and hysteria. He gave
a few quick orders, in a voice so tense and
strange that the officers scarcely knew it.
His wild, stark energy stirred officers and men
into invincibleness. It was as if the fate
of all the world and all time hung upon
what he could accomplish in the few minutes
thus permitted him. He dared not stop to
think.</p>

<p>Slowly the enemy crumbled. The sun
struggled through the clouds and the colors
shone in glorified indistinctness in a wet
glitter of sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>It was over now. He turned his horse
and rode slowly back towards the tent.
“Don’t follow me,” he said, curtly. And
he rode back, slowly and alone. The cry
of the cannon was now triumphant and glad.
A shell, whirling above him, spluttered in
futile animosity. The wild cheering was
music to his ears.</p>

<p>His dream was over now—the dream he
had dreamed when he longed to enlist. He
flung up his arms and laughed aloud. His
dream! To enlist as a private, to win
patiently through grades of sergeant and
lieutenant, to captain and colonel and general
in command!</p>

<p>He wearily dropped from his horse. He
went into the tent. The Captain of Company
Q looked down upon the General’s
peaceful face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br>

<small>MIDSHIPMAN JACK, U.S.N.</small></h2>

<p class="center"><i>The Action of Appalachicola</i></p>




<p class="drop-cap">“I AM not one of those fellows who
‘can fight and run away, and live
to fight some other day,’” one
of the bravest Lieutenant-Commanders
in the United States navy said one
evening to a party of friends, who were
making him feel uncomfortable by discussing
his brilliant war record. “My bad leg won’t
let me run, so I always have to stand and
fight it out.”</p>

<p>“Why, Commander,” one of his friends
exclaimed, “I did not know that you had a
bad leg. You do not limp.”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, “not ordinarily. But
when I tire myself I limp a little, and if I were
to undertake to run I should come to grief.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Where did you receive your injury?”
another asked.</p>

<p>“In action at Appalachicola,” the Commander
replied; “the severest action I ever
saw.”</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in his eyes as he spoke,
and he looked about the table to see what
effect the words had upon his friends. Two
of them merely muttered their sympathy,
and the third asked for the story of the fight;
but the fourth man looked up with a comical
expression that told the Commander he was
understood in one quarter at least.</p>

<p>“You will certainly have to tell us about
that,” this fourth man laughed, seeing that
the Commander was waiting for a question;
“for I have always understood that Appalachicola,
being an out-of-the-way place, was
one of the few Southern towns that escaped
without a scratch in the war. I never heard
of any battle there.”</p>

<p>“No, there was no battle there,” the Commander
replied, “and you would hardly hear
of the action, because there were so few engaged
in it. In fact, I was the only one on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the Federal side, and there were no Confederates.
When I was a boy there I fell out
of a pine-tree and broke my thigh; so it was
my own action, and one that I still have
reason to remember.”</p>

<p>This was the Commander’s modest way of
describing an accident that brought out all
the manliness he had in him, and made him
an officer in the United States navy, and he
seldom gives any other account of it; but
some of the grown-up boys of Appalachicola
tell the story in a very different way—the
same “boys,” some of them, who used to
set out in parties of three or four and chase
young Jack Radway and make life miserable
for him.</p>

<p>Jack had a strange habit, when he was
between fifteen and sixteen (this is the way
they tell the story in Appalachicola), of going
down to the wharf and sitting by the half-hour
on the end of a spile, looking out over
the bay. That was in 1862. His name was
not Jack Radway, but that is a fairly good
sort of name, and on account of the Commander’s
modesty it will have to answer for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the present. While he sat in this way it was
necessary for him to keep the corner of one
eye on the wharf and the adjacent street,
watching for enemies. Oddly enough, every
white boy in the town was Jack’s enemy,
generous as he was, and brave and good-hearted;
and when one came alone, or even
two, if they were not too big, he was always
ready to stay and defend himself. But
when three or four came together he was
forced to retire to his father’s big brick warehouse,
across the street. They would not
follow him there, because it was well known
that the rifle standing beside the desk was
always kept loaded.</p>

<p>This enmity with the other boys, for no
fault of his own, was Jack’s great sorrow.
A year or two before he had been a favorite
with all the boys and girls, and now he was
hungry for a single friend of his own age.
The reason of it was that his father was the
only Union man in Appalachicola. Every
white man, woman, and child in the town
sympathized with the Confederacy, except
John Radway and his wife and their son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Jack. The elder Radway had thought it
over when the trouble began, and had made
up his mind that his allegiance belonged to
the old government that his grandfather had
fought for.</p>

<p>Near the mouth of the river lay the United
States gun-boat <i>Alleghany</i>, guarding the
harbor, with the stars and stripes floating
bravely at her stern.</p>

<p>“Look at that flag,” Jack’s father told him.
“Your great-grandfather fought for it, and
I want you always to honor it. It is the
grandest flag in the whole world. It is my
flag and yours, and you must never desert it.”</p>

<p>By the side of Mr. Radway’s house stood
a tall pine-tree, much higher than the top
of the house, with no limbs growing out of the
trunk except at the very top, after the manner
of Southern pines. Jack was a great
climber, and nearly every day, when he did
not go down-town, he “shinned” up this tall
tree to make sure that the gun-boat was still
in the harbor. And one day, the day of
what the Commander calls “the action at
Appalachicola,” he lost his hold in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
way, or a limb broke, and he fell from the
top to the ground.</p>

<p>For some time he lay there unconscious,
and when he came to his senses he could not
get up. There was a terrible pain in his left
hip, and he called for help, and his mother
and some of the colored women ran out and
carried him into the house, and when they
laid him on a bed he fainted again from the
pain.</p>

<p>Mr. Radway was sent for, and after he had
examined the leg as well as he could, he
looked very solemn, for there was no doubt
that the bone was badly broken. Even
Jack, young as he was, could tell that;
but with all his pain he made no complaint.</p>

<p>“This is serious business,” Mr. Radway said
to his wife when they were out of Jack’s hearing.
“The bone is badly fractured at the thigh,
and there is not a doctor left in Appalachicola
to set it. Every one of them is away
in the army, and I don’t know of a doctor
within a hundred miles.”</p>

<p>“Except on the gun-boat,” Mrs. Radway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
interrupted; “there must be a surgeon on the
gun-boat.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that,” Mr. Radway
answered; “but if he should come ashore he
would almost certainly be killed, so I could
not ask him to come. And if I should take
Jack out to the boat, we would very likely
be attacked on the way. I must take time
to think.”</p>

<p>Medicines were scarce in Appalachicola in
those days, but they gave Jack a few drops
of laudanum to ease the pain, and made a
cushion of pillows for his leg. For all his
terrible suffering, and the doubt about getting
the bone set, he did not utter a word
of complaint. But he turned white as the
pillows, and the great heat of midsummer on
the shore of the Gulf added to his misery.</p>

<p>For hours Mr. Radway walked the floor,
trying to make up his mind what to do.
Jack’s suffering was agony to him, and the
uncertainty of getting help increased it.
Late in the evening, when all the household
were in bed but Mr. and Mrs. Radway, they
heard the sound of many feet coming up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
walk, then a shuffling of feet on the piazza,
and a heavy knock at the front door.</p>

<p>“Have they the heart for that?” Mr. Radway
exclaimed. “Could they come to attack
us when they know what trouble we are
in? Some of them shall pay dearly for it
if they have.”</p>

<p>The knock was repeated, louder than before,
and Mr. Radway took up a rifle and
started for the door. Standing the rifle in
the corner of the wall, and with a cocked
revolver in one hand, he turned the key and
opened the door a crack, keeping one foot
well braced against it.</p>

<p>“You don’t need your gun, neighbor,” said
the spokesman of the party without; “it’s
a peaceable errand we are on this time.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” Mr. Radway asked, still
suspicious.</p>

<p class="caption">“COULD THEY COME TO ATTACK US WHEN THEY<br> KNOW WHAT TROUBLE WE ARE IN?”</p>

<p>“We know the trouble you are in,” the
man continued, “and we are sorry for you.
It’s not John Radway we are down on; it’s
his principles; but we want to forget them
till we get you out of this scrape. There are
twenty of us here, all your neighbors and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
former friends. We know there is no doctor
in Appalachicola, and we have come to say
that if you can get the surgeon of the gun-boat
to come ashore and mend up the sick
lad, he shall have safe-conduct both ways.
We will guard him ourselves, and we pledge
our word that not a hair of his head shall be
touched.”</p>

<p>This friendly act came nearer to breaking
down John Radway’s bold front than all the
persecutions he had been subjected to. He
threw the door wide open, put the revolver in
his pocket, and grasped the spokesman’s hand.</p>

<p>“I need not try to thank you,” he said;
“you know what I would say if I could. My
poor Jack is in great pain, and I shall make
up my mind between this and daylight what
had better be done.”</p>

<p>The knowledge that he was surrounded by
friends instead of enemies made Jack feel better
in a few minutes; but the pain was too
great to be relieved permanently in such a
way, and all night long he lay with his teeth
shut tight, determined to make no complaint.</p>

<p>By daylight he was in such a high fever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
that his father had no further doubts about
what to do. He must have medical attendance
at once; and the quickest way was to
take him out to the gun-boat, rather than
risk the delay of getting the surgeon ashore.
So a cot-bed was converted into a stretcher
by lashing handles to the sides. Colored
men were sent for to carry it, and another
was sent down to the shore to make Mr.
Radway’s little boat ready.</p>

<p>The morning sun was just beginning to
gild the smooth water of Appalachicola Bay,
when the after-watchman on the gun-boat’s
deck, who for some time had been watching
a little sail-boat with half a table-cloth flying
at the mast-head, called out:</p>

<p>“Small flag-of-truce boat on the port
quarter!”</p>

<p>Jack Radway, lying on the stretcher in
the bottom of the boat, heard the words repeated
in a lower tone, evidently at the door
of the Captain’s cabin: “Small flag-of-truce
boat on the port quarter, sir.”</p>

<p>An instant later a young officer appeared
at the rail with a marine-glass in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Ahoy there in the boat!” he called. “Put
up your helm! Sheer off!”</p>

<p>The <i>Alleghany</i> lay in an enemy’s waters,
and she was not to be caught napping. Nothing
was allowed to approach without giving
a good reason for it.</p>

<p>Then Jack’s father stood up in the boat.
“I have a boy here with a broken thigh,”
he said. “I want your surgeon to set it.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” the officer asked.</p>

<p>“John Radway—a loyal man,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>The name was as good as a passport, for the
gun-boat people had heard of John Radway.</p>

<p>“Come alongside,” the officer called; and
five minutes later a big sailor had Jack in his
arms, carrying him up the gangway, and he
was taken into the boat’s hospital and laid on
another cot. It was an unusual thing on a
naval vessel, and when the big bluff surgeon
came the Captain was with him, and several
more of the officers.</p>

<p>The examination gave Jack more pain than
he had had before, but still he kept his teeth
clinched, and refused even to moan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“It is a bad fracture, and should have
been attended to sooner,” the surgeon said at
length. “There is nothing to be done for it
now but to take off the leg.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not!” Mr. Radway exclaimed.
“Is there no other way?”</p>

<p>“He knows best, father,” Jack said; “he
will do the best he can for me.”</p>

<p>“He is too weak now for an operation,”
the surgeon continued; “but you can leave
him with me, and I think by to-morrow he
will be able to stand it.”</p>

<p>If Jack had made the least fuss at the
prospect of having his leg cut off, or had let
a single groan escape, there is hardly any
doubt that he would be limping through life
on one leg. But the brave way that he bore
the pain and the doctor’s verdict made him
a powerful friend.</p>

<p>The Captain of a naval vessel cannot control
his surgeon’s treatment of a case; but
the Captain’s wishes naturally go a long way,
even with the surgeon. So it was a great
point for Jack when the Captain interceded
for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“There’s the making of an Admiral in that
lad in the hospital,” the Captain told the
doctor later in the day. “I never saw a boy
bear pain better. I wish you would save his
leg if you possibly can.”</p>

<p>“He’d be well much quicker to take it off,”
the surgeon retorted. “But I’ll give him
every chance I can. There is a bare possibility
that I may be able to save it.”</p>

<p>There was joy in the Radway family when
it became known that there was a chance of
saving Jack’s leg; but all that Jack himself
would say was, “Leave it all to the doctor;
he will do what he can.”</p>

<p>Three weeks afterwards Jack still lay in the
<i>Alleghany’s</i> hospital with two legs to his
body, but one half hidden in splints and
plaster. Mr. and Mrs. Radway visited him
every day, and the broken bone was healing
so nicely that the doctor thought that in
three or four weeks more Jack might be able
to hobble about the deck on crutches, when
more trouble came. A new gun-boat steamed
into the harbor to take the <i>Alleghany’s</i> place,
bringing orders for the <i>Alleghany</i> to go at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
to the Brooklyn Navy-Yard. This was particularly
unfortunate for Jack, for his broken
bone was just in that state where the motion
of taking him ashore would be likely to displace
it. But that unwelcome order from
Washington proved to be a long step towards
making Jack one of our American naval
heroes.</p>

<p>“It would be a great risk to take him
ashore,” the surgeon said to Mr. Radway.
“The least movement of the leg would set
him back to where we began. You had
much better let him go North with us. The
voyage will do him good; and even if we
are not sent back here, he can easily make
his way home when he is able to travel.”</p>

<p>Nothing could have suited Jack better
than this, for he had become attached to the
gun-boat and her officers; so it was soon
settled that he was to lie still on his bed and
be carried to Brooklyn. For more than a
month he lay there without seeing anything
of the great city on either side of him; and
the <i>Alleghany</i> was already under orders to
sail for Key West before he was able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
venture on deck with a crutch under each
arm. There were delays in getting away,
so by the time the gun-boat was steaming
down the coast Jack was walking slowly
about her deck with a cane, and the color was
in his cheeks again and the old sparkle in his
eyes. He was in hopes of finding a schooner
at Key West that would carry him to Appalachicola;
but he was not to see the old
town again for many a day.</p>

<p>The <i>Alleghany</i> was a little below Hatteras,
when she sighted a Confederate blockade-runner,
and she immediately gave chase.
But, much to the surprise of the officers, this
blockade-runner did not run away, as they
generally did. She was much larger than
the <i>Alleghany</i>, and well manned and armed,
and she preferred to stay and fight. Almost
before he knew it Jack was in the midst of a
hot naval battle. The two vessels were soon
close together, and there was such a thunder
of guns and such a smother of smoke that he
does not pretend to remember exactly what
happened. But after it was all over, and
the blockade-runner was a prize, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
stars and stripes flying from her stern, Jack
walked as straight as anybody down to the
little hospital where he had spent so many
weeks.</p>

<p>His mother would hardly have known him
as he stepped into the hospital and waited
till the surgeon had time to take a big splinter
from his left arm.</p>

<p>“Where’s your cane, young man?” the
surgeon asked, when Jack’s turn came.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir!” Jack replied, surprised
to find himself standing without it. “I
must have forgotten all about it. I saw one
of the gunners fall, and I took his place, and
that’s all I remember, sir, except seeing the
enemy strike her colors.”</p>

<p>That action made Jack a Midshipman in
the United States navy, and gave him a
share in the prize-money, and a year later he
was an Ensign. For special gallantry in
action in Mobile Bay he was made a Lieutenant
before the close of the war, and in the
long years since then he has risen more slowly
to the rank of Lieutenant-Commander.</p>

<small>CAPTAIN BILLY</small></h2>

<p class="center"><i>Aid and Comfort to the Enemy</i></p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i221.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="W">

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the General invited the Fortescue
girls and their friends to
spend an evening in the house on
the Square, it was always understood
that part of the entertainment was to
be a “war story,” and, on the special evening
I refer to, a barrel of apples, sent from the
“northern part of the State,” gave the subject.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Molly,” said the General to the
girl, whom the old nurse now called “the eldest
Miss Fortescue,” “you can put the apples
out; and they’ve just made me remember I
never told you about ‘Tobacco Billy,’” and
as his eager auditors settled themselves comfortably
about the fire, the General, with his
peculiar quiet smile, began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Just hand me down that old photograph
in the little black frame; there you are—poor
old Tobacco Billy!”</p>

<p>“<i>Old!</i>” exclaimed Tom Fortescue, in surprise,
for the picture was that of a plain-looking,
rather gawky lad of only nineteen—a
“boy in blue”—with honesty and fearlessness
in every line of his homely, gentle
face.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t say in years, perhaps,” said
the General, “but in wisdom. Anyway,
here’s his story. Give that coal a stir, will
you. Now, then, here we are:</p>

<p>“We were in camp, not very far from
Charleston, and it was a pretty serious business
with us. You see, we hadn’t the least
idea what the enemy were up to. My particular
friend, Captain Kard, of the Confederate
army, and I were talking about it not long
ago, and he said he well remembered how,
on their side, they were chuckling over our
perplexity. Well, I must tell you that at the
extreme end of our camp we had a bridge,
and it was regularly patrolled by two of the
men I picked out for the purpose, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
‘other side’ had a place beyond similarly
patrolled. If any message had to be sent
over, the sentries reversed their guns as a
signal of truce, and word was exchanged.</p>

<p>“Now although we were pretty badly off
for provisions, and even ammunition, it
wasn’t a circumstance to the condition of the
‘Johnnies,’ as we called the gentlemen over
the way, and, worst of all, the poor chaps
hadn’t the comfort of a ‘smoke’ even, which,
as all soldiers will tell you, keeps the gnawing
feeling of hunger away for a time at least.
No, sir! they hadn’t five pounds of tobacco
in their camp. But never mind! I’ll tell
you what they did have. They had regularly
every day a copy of their own Charleston
paper, which, of course, was printed for
Confederate eyes alone. I was sitting in my
tent one night smoking and thinking and
wondering how I could lay hands on one or
two of those papers. You must know, my
dear children, stratagem is always allowed
and understood to be used on both sides in
war. It is as much a part of the whole unhappy
business as loading guns and firing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
them, and far better if it leads to peace and
an end of cruel feeling. Now, if I could only
get a copy or two of those papers, do you see,
the key to the enemy’s next movements
might be in our hands, and I suddenly struck
a bright idea. I sent a man to replace Billy
Forbes on the bridge, and presently that
lad appeared in my doorway. He saluted,
and I motioned him to come inside. Then,
after warning him of the need of secrecy
and caution, I told him my dilemma. Billy
rubbed his head, whistled softly, looked up
and down anxiously, and finally, after a moment’s
star-gazing, ‘Lieutenant,’ says he, in
his slow, Connecticut voice, ‘I’ve hit on a
way—if you don’t mind.’</p>

<p>“‘Go ahead, Billy,’ I rejoined.</p>

<p>“‘Well, sir, you see those poor devils have
scarcely a chew or a smoke of ’baccy among
them.’</p>

<p>“‘How do you know?’</p>

<p>“‘Johnny on the other side made signs, sir,
and mate and I weren’t slow to understand.’</p>

<p>“‘Well. Go on.’</p>

<p>“‘Now, if I could sneak over a bit from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
those great packages in the Quartermaster’s
department, and make him know what we
were after, sure as guns, Lieutenant, you’d
have the papers.’</p>

<p>“‘Billy,’ said I, ‘you are a credit to your
regiment, to say nothing of your Yankee
mother. Come here in an hour, and I’ll see
you have the tobacco.’</p>

<p>“Some enterprising dealer in the North had
received a contract for that lot of stuff, and
we had really, for the time being, an overabundance,
so that it was by no means a
difficult matter for me to secure two half-pound
packets, done up in blue paper, and
in about as short a time as it takes to tell the
story, Billy Forbes had it tucked away, and
went whistling back to his post.</p>

<p>“It was a clear, soft, starlit night. I sat
up attending to various duties—listening to
the fussy complaints and talk of one of my
colleagues in command, who had it on the
brain, and felt we were disgraced not knowing
how to get in there. Somehow, I relied
on my friend Billy to win the day by his fair
‘exchange,’ and he didn’t fail me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Towards morning I went down to the
bridge, having sent a relief for the lad, who
came back simply grinning.</p>

<p>“‘Easy as could be,’ he whispered. ‘Here
you are, sir.’</p>

<p>“And from the depths of his trousers he
produced the coveted little sheets.</p>

<p>“‘Billy,’ said I, ‘when the war is over you
are likely to be a great man.’</p>

<p>“And I turned in to read the news.</p>

<p>“About ten o’clock I received an awful
message, in answer to which I started post-haste
for the guard-house, meeting my
anxious comrade Captain Hubert on the
way.</p>

<p>“‘A nice mess your <i>protégé</i> is in, Lieutenant!’
he exclaimed. ‘I’ve had to put
him under arrest, and he’s doomed, sir,
doomed. Will no doubt be shot, and a good
warning to all like him.’</p>

<p>“As the Captain—in temporary command—marched
on, I stood rooted to the ground.
What had happened! Well, I soon found
out. Billy, white to the lips, but with his
head well up, told me the story. His companion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
cherishing some old grudge, had
watched him making the exchange—tobacco
for the journals—and had made haste to
report him. Billy well knew the penalty. A
court-martial had to be held at once.</p>

<p>“Billy, poor lad, for violating the law which
forbids absolutely giving aid or comfort to
the enemy, must be shot! That was the law,
and you must bear in mind that the well-being
of a whole nation, especially in time
of war, depends upon the strict discipline
of the army being maintained. There were
important reasons why I could not at that
moment say I had, through Billy, procured
the papers, and relieve him of the extreme
penalty. Yet something must be done, and
I must try and think it out, even though in
discharging my duty I must sit in the court-martial
which would undoubtedly condemn
him.</p>

<p>“‘Billy,’ said I, with my hand on the lad’s
shoulder, and looking at his white and
haggard young face, ‘I’ll do my best. Unless
compelled to, don’t mention the papers.
That can’t be known just yet.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“‘God bless you, sir,’ said Billy, with tears
rolling down his cheeks. ‘You see, mother’d
be proud if I had to die in battle; but shot
down, Lieutenant, for treason—’</p>

<p>“Well, I can tell you, I couldn’t stand it
much longer, and I went dismally enough to
the court-martial. You needn’t imagine it
was in any fine court-room. Dignified and
often tragic as were the cases, the court sat in
an old tool-shed; planks on barrels formed
the tables, and for seats we had empty
provision boxes turned upside down. But
there was about it the solemnity of such an
occasion—of a death charge, perhaps, and
all the grave formality of the promptest law
known. When in the paltry place the court-martial
began I knew that my colleague,
Captain Hubert, was in a great state of excitement,
and determined, if possible, to ‘put
down’ such recklessness as had been Billy
Forbes’s. We had some minor cases first
quickly disposed of, and then my poor fellow
was led up.</p>

<p class="caption">MEAN AS WERE THE SURROUNDINGS IT MADE A TRAGIC SCENE</p>

<p>“Mean as were the surroundings, I assure
you it made a tragic scene. And there the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Connecticut lad stood—thinking of the mother
who could never bear to hear of shame
upon her soldier boy, nor care to hear after
where they had made his grave.</p>

<p>“The Captain began the formal questioning;
and Billy, in a clear, low voice, answered.
Asked if he knew what it meant to converse
with the enemy, he said:</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Had he reversed his gun?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Had he handed the enemy a package?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘What did it contain?’</p>

<p>“‘Tobacco, sir.’</p>

<p>“Billy whitened again, but he did not lie;
and I seemed to read in the depths of his blue
eyes a thought of ‘mother.’ There was a
brief pause, and then I knew my moment had
come. From my coat-pocket I produced a
packet of the tobacco sent by our Northern
contractor.</p>

<p>“‘Forbes.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Was the tobacco you gave the enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
like this?’ I spoke, breaking a deathlike
stillness.</p>

<p>“Billy’s lips quivered. His look was like
Cæsar’s ‘<i>Et tu, Brute!</i>’ But he did not
flinch. Honest eye and proudly uplifted
head were there when he answered, ‘Yes,
sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Captain Hubert,’ I observed, turning to
my superior, ‘there is a cart-load of the stuff
still unused, for the reason that this tobacco
was condemned as unfit, owing to some
poisonous substance in the blue paper
wrappers. I need scarcely point out to you,’
I continued, ‘that sentence of death could
only be passed on Forbes for “carrying aid or
comfort to the enemy.” Now, then, Captain,
if you will kindly fill your pipe from this
package, I feel sure you will decide whether
Forbes can be condemned to death for
providing the Johnnies with comfort from old
Briggs’s consignment.’</p>

<p>“The tension was too great for even a smile,
and Captain Hubert’s face flushed scarlet.
He put out his hand, then drew it back.
‘This being the case,’ said he, in a stifled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
voice and rising to his feet, ‘we—we—can
consider the case dismissed!’</p>

<p>“I met Billy a moment or two later, standing
like a statue near my quarters. He
looked at me piteously; but when I held out
my hand, did not at once take it.</p>

<p>“‘Lieutenant,’ said he, with the queer
smile in his honest eyes I somehow felt he’d
learned from his mother, ‘I—I—God bless
you, sir; but did you send me with poison to
those poor chaps?’ His voice shook, but he
held up his head proudly. ‘Killing them
in battle, sir, would be fair and square—’</p>

<p>“‘Billy,’ said I, ‘give me your hand, and
you’ll get your shoulder-straps before the
week is out! No, my boy! I picked out
papers that hadn’t a speck of white stain on
them. No, you’re not a murderer, my poor
Billy; and go to your tent and write to your
mother, for we’re near a battle harder than
the one you and I fought this morning,
thanks to the papers from the enemy.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, General!” exclaimed Molly, “and
what happened then?”</p>

<p>“Why, my child, Billy went home on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
furlough six months later Captain Forbes, if
you please, and at present he owns a fine
country grocery, from which the apples
you’re eating this minute have just come, as
they do every year regularly, and not once
but he encloses a big packet of tobacco
marked, ‘<i>Not dangerous, General, even to the
enemy!</i>’”</p>

<small>THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER</small></h2>

<p class="center"><i>A Dangerous Prize</i></p>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i081.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="N">


<p class="drop-cap">“NOW, Lieutenant, the yarn,” said
I, as I settled myself comfortably.
A heavy sea was running; night
had fallen; we were off watch, and
snugly stowed between decks, with our legs
under the gun-room table, and—jollier still—Lieutenant
Bracetaut had promised a yarn.
He looked musingly at the oscillating lantern
above our heads, and then made a beginning:</p>

<p>“It was not in these days of iron pots,
cheese-boxes, and steam-engines, you must
know,” said he; “but on the dear old frigate
<i>Florida</i>—requiescat in pace!—without her
mate before a stiff breeze, and with more
rats in her hold than in a North Sea whaler.
We were the flag-ship of the African squadron.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Prize-money was scarce, and the days
frightfully hot; when just as the day dropped
at the close of September, we were overjoyed
to hear tidings of—”</p>

<p>“All hands on deck if you want a share in
this prize!” bawled the boatswain down the
companionway; and we ungraciously tumbled
up, snapping Bracetaut’s yarn without
compunction.</p>

<p>“Where is she?”</p>

<p>“What is she?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see her.”</p>

<p>“There she is to the sou’west,” said the
cockswain, pointing with his spy-glass.</p>

<p>“By Jove, a steamer, too!” cried Bracetaut,
delightedly.</p>

<p>“The <i>Great Eastern</i>, stuffed with cotton
to her scuppers,” suggested Jerry Bloom,
commencing a hornpipe; and every one else
had some guess as to the character of the
strange craft.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i083.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">CHASING A BLOCKADE-RUNNER<br>

(From a contemporary picture in <i>Harper’s Weekly</i>)</p>

<p>“Bracetaut is right,” said the Captain of
the <i>Petrel</i>, who had been studying her intently
with his telescope; “she’s a steamer,
and a big ’un. But she’s not coming out;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
she’s making for the Lights with her best
foot foremost.”</p>

<p>We were glad to hear it; for even cotton
could be foregone for the sake of English
rifles, hospital stores, and army stuffs. We
cracked on more steam, unfurled the top-gallants,
and made all preparations for a
short chase. We had been to Philadelphia
for coal, and were still fifty knots from our
old blockading station on the North Carolina
coast, to which we were returning. There
was a heavy sea from the tempest of the day
before; but the sky was cloudless and the
moon unusually bright, and our craft was the
swiftest in the squadron; so that, with so
much sea-room, we had little doubt of overhauling
the stranger before she could reach
the protecting guns of Fort Macon. A mere
speck at first, the object of our attention
grew rapidly bigger as we sped on under the
extra head of steam and the straining top-gallants.
She enlarged against the sky until
she grew as big as a whale, and in a few
moments we distinguished the column of
black smoke which her low chimneys trailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
against the sky; but she seemed to have little
canvas stretched. Indeed, the gale was yet
so strong that any extensive spread of sail
was imprudent.</p>

<p>“See what you make of her, Bracetaut,”
said the Captain, handing his telescope to
the weather-worn seaman. “I would be sure
that she’s none of our own.”</p>

<p>“Clyde-built all over,” mused the Lieutenant,
with his eye to the tube. “No one
but a Cockney could have planted her masts;
and her jib has the Bristol cut. She sees
you and is doing her best. I doubt if you
catch her.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” retorted the
skipper. “Let out the studdin’ sails! trim
the jib!” he roared through his trumpet.
“I’ll spread every rag if we scrape the sky!
More head if possible, Jones,” he added; and
the engineer went below to see what could
be done.</p>

<p>The gale was strong, and her head of steam
was already great; but we soon seemed to
leap from crest to crest under the stimulus of
replenished fires, and the masts fairly bowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
beneath their press of canvas. Everybody
was agog with excitement, and half the seamen
were in the rigging gazing ahead and
speculating as to the vessel and her contents.</p>

<p>“Try her with the big bow-chaser, Captain,”
suggested the Lieutenant; and the order
was immediately given.</p>

<p>Boom! went the huge piece, as we quivered
on the summit of a lofty wave, and the rushing
bolt flashed a phosphorescent light from
a dozen crests ere its course was lost in the
distance.</p>

<p>“No, go! it’s a good three miles,” growled
Captain Butler, measuring the interval once
more with his glass.</p>

<p>“Let me try,” said Bracetaut, quietly
taking his stand behind the gun, which was
now being charged anew, and carefully adjusting
the screws.</p>
